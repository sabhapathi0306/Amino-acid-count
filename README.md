# Amino-acid-count
it contain python code to count Amino acid in Amino acid sequence from given DNA sequence


With help this python code we can get know which Amino acid can be traslated from given DNA (fasta) sequence

# output

# steps
1. write down the above code ,if error free
2. capy and paste the Nucleotide fasta sequence from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
3. Run for out you will all Bases and GC % count 
4. with help pandas a csv file is created from  Amino acid dictnory
5. file will be saved i your current working folder 
6. Open the saved filen and read with help of pandas
7. analysis done with graphical reprsentation using matplotlib



Easly you can analys the higest number of Amino acid presence in sequnece from given fasta sequence
